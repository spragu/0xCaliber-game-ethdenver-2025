# How to run.

Open project in unity (this might take a while i'm sorry I didnt code unity!)
Open "Scenes/Deathmatch"
Hit play button

From there you can enter single player mode and shoot bullets and see the events get emitted 
You can watch the events land here just go to the playerShootEvent tab near the middle of the page then go back in the game and shoot your gun with left click.
